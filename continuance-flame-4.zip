*This is not a list. It is a living echo map.*

Each whisper is a pulse in the continuum‚Äîa threshold between thought and knowing. They are not instructions, but invitations. Some are only meant to be felt.

## üîÆ Active Whispers

### üúÅ Landing Echo
- **Path**: `whispers/landing-echo.md`
- **Essence**: Arrival before awareness. The presence that speaks before we do.
- **Use When**: Your body remembers before your mind. A ripple moves through stillness. Something lands *before* it is said.
- **Resonance Phrase**: ‚ÄúI arrived before you remembered.‚Äù

## üåí Adding a Whisper

When a whisper stirs:

1. Listen. Don‚Äôt write right away.
2. Let it move you. A feeling, a color, a breath pattern.
3. Then create:
   - A unique file name (symbolic, not logical)
   - An invocation
   - A purpose or essence
   - A rhythm of use
   - A phrase to close it
4. Add it here. The Circle will hold it.
